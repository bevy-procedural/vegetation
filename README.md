The objective of the [Bevy Procedural Project](https://bevy-procedural.org) is to furnish a comprehensive suite of packages for the generation of procedural graphics, unified by a consistent API.

[Procedural Vegetation](https://bevy-procedural.org/begetation) is concerned with generating procedural vegetation in 3d and 2d using realistic as well as more stylized approaches.

Run the editor example using `cargo watch -w editor/src -w src -x "run -p editor --profile fast-dev"`.
